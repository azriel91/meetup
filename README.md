The repository of resources for rust-akl meetup.

# About
We are a meetup in Auckland, New Zealand for the Rust programming language. Rust is a powerful and unique programming language with a passionate userbase worldwide.

This meetup is intended to facilitate learning and discussions around Rust and its ecosystem. The primary goals are:

1. To create a gathering for Rust users and enthusiasts to share knowledge and to collaborate.
2. To welcome and help Rust newcomers to learn and be productive with Rust.
3. To promote the usage and knowledge of Rust in Auckland.

Currently we are planning to meet once every month. We're always open to talk proposals or activity ideas.
