# Rust Auckland Meetup
The repository of resources for rust-akl meetup.

# About
We are a meetup in Auckland, New Zealand for the Rust programming language. Rust is a really interesting and unique programming language with a small but passionate user base world wide.

This meetup is intended to facilitate learning and discussions around Rust and its ecosystem. The primary goals are:

1. To create a gathering for Rust users and enthusiasts to share knowledge and to collaborate.
2. To welcome and help Rust newcomers to learn and be productive with Rust.
3. To promote the usage and knowledge of Rust in Auckland.

Currently we are planning to meet once every month. We're always open to talk proposals or activity ideas.

# Sponsorship

The meetup is at its early stage and are looking for stable sponsors (for meetup space and/or food).

# Talks and Material
Please feel free to reach out if you are keen to give a talk, or have suggestions for content or activities for future meetups. We are especially keen to hear from people who have used Rust in production!
