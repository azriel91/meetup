## Rust AKL Inauguration üëã

---

## Rust Introduction

What is Rust? What makes it special? + introduction to core concepts.

Talk by ***Tom Arrell***

Slides will be available at https://github.com/rust-akl/meetup

<sub>Special thanks to <strong>Movio</strong> for providing the venue, food and drinks!</sub>

---

## Going forward

Going forward with this meetup, we would like to foster the following.

- Encourage new/all speakers
- For all skill levels, beginner to advanced
- Learn!

---

## Goal of this Talk

Motivate new Rustaceans.

We want beginners to be motivated to pick up and learn Rust for their next project.

This will provide a hopefully smooth segway into the benefits of Rust, and why you might want to learn the language over say something else.

---

Alright, let's crack into it...

---

## What is Rust? ü§î

Rust is a **systems programming language**... Meaning it gives you more direct access to **memory allocation**, **IO facilities** and/or **peripheral system hardware** ‚Äî all while keeping memory and **runtime cost minimal** and enabling 'fearless concurrency'.

But more importantly. It is:

- Compiled
- Statically typed (all types known at compile time)
- Strongly typed (strict type assertions)
- Memory safe (compile-time prevention of common segfaults)
- Functional (first-class functions, immutability, et al)
- Modern, composable, fun!

---

*1st Place* for "most loved programming language" - **Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2016, 2017 and 2018.** üèÜ

---

## Features

- zero-cost abstractions
- move semantics (transferring ownership)
- guaranteed memory safety
- threads without data races üèÉ
- trait-based generics
- pattern matching
- type inference
- minimal runtime (no need for a garbage collector)
- efficient C bindings
- meta programming (declarative and procedural)

---

## Lesser-Known Tooling QOL Tidbits

- Package management system ‚Äî Cargo
- Automatic documentation generation ‚Äî Docs.rs
- RustFmt - automatic code formatting
- Clippy - powerful linting
- Fantastic error messages (most of the time), very useful for compiler driven development shops

---

## Sidenote

Rust has a fantastic community. The core teams are known for being extremely approachable and hanging out in several IRC channels, being more than willing to answer community questions. The subreddit is also a great place to go to get help.

I consider this a significant feature in itself.

---

## Rust Goals ü•Ö

Rust is "fundamentally about *empowerment*: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with **confidence** in a **wider variety of domains** than you did before."

It persues the trifecta of *"safety, speed, and concurrency"* in its design decisions.

---

Because of these goals, Rust is *expressive enough* to build **web servers**, allowing for abstractions on top of requests, entities etc ‚Äî *without sacrificing* its **bare-metal capabilities**. Easy FFI to C/C++ code, and manual memory manipulation through clearly marked unsafe code blocks.

This allows for wrapping common unsafe code in **safe** interfaces.

---

## New Concepts üîÆ

Rust also introduces a few potentially unfamiliar concepts to a lot of people in order to carry out it's goals.

---

- **Ownership**

The concept that memory is owned by a variable.

- **Borrowing**

The semantics around how that memory can be shared between other pieces of code.

**...**

---

**...**

- **Lifetimes**

The automatic allocation and deallocation of memory for a given lifetime. <- How Rust can get away without manual memory management + no garbage collector.

- **Smart Pointers**

Pointers, with a little additional meta-data alongside traditional pointers. (C++)

..and maybe a few more, depending on whether you come from a systems or application programming background‚Äîor this is your first language!

---

## Borrowing (cont...)

Borring a reference to a piece of memory in Rust takes **two** forms.

- **Immutable**
- **Mutable**

---

## Immutable Borrow

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
```
>> The length of 'hello' is 5.
```

---

## Mutable Borrow (Fail)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```
```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable borrowed content `*some_string` as mutable
 --> error.rs:8:5
  |
7 | fn change(some_string: &String) {
  |                        ------- use `&mut String` here to make mutable
8 |     some_string.push_str(", world");
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
```

---

## Mutable Borrow (Success)

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("Hello");

    change(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", World!");
}
```
```
>> Hello, World!
```

---

## Composition

Rust's type system uses **generics** in order to define generic behaviour which acts over arbitrary types. However in to inform the compiler the behaviour attached to a paritcular type, or bound the behaviour to types which implement specific functionality, Rust uses traits.

Rust favours **composition** over **inheritance**. This comes in the form of **traits**. Traits are a core aspect to generic programming in Rust.

Traits allow you to define a common interface for a type which implements the trait.

---

```rust
pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

---

## Microservices in Rust

Rust has many multi-purose, fast web-frameworks to help build high level web services. Some of these are based on the **Tokio** runtime (event loop, similar to Node.js).

*A popular choice is **Rocket**:* https://rocket.rs/

A neat alternative is also **Warp**.

---

## Example: Warp

Warp is a Rust web framework for building applications using a combinator API.

Inspired by Scala's Finch and Akka libraries.

## Projects Using Rust

There are tons of large scale projects using Rust right now. Some of these for example:

**Xi** - Google text editor
- https://github.com/google/xi-editor

**Servo** - Mozilla's new browser engine
- https://github.com/servo/servo

**...**

**...**

**Alacritty** - Cross platform GPU-accelerated terminal
- https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty

**Rocket** - A web framework for Rust
- https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket

**Ripgrep** - A fast as heck grep alternative
- https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

## Resources

The Rust team maintains a book called "**The Rust Programming Language**." It is an invaluable resource for those of you looking to learn the language inside and out.

You can find the 2018 edition of the book at: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
